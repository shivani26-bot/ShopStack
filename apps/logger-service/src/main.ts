// The WebSocket server itself creates and listens on a TCP port (6008 here).
// That means you‚Äôd have two separate servers:
// Express (HTTP server)
// WebSocket server
// üëâ Which is messy if you want both HTTP & WebSocket traffic on the same port
// noServer:trueThe WebSocket server does not listen on a port.
// Instead, you manually ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù incoming HTTP requests to WebSocket.

const server = http.createServer(app);

// server = your HTTP server (created with http.createServer(app)).
// "upgrade" = a special event in Node.js HTTP.
// It‚Äôs triggered when a client (usually a browser) says:
// ‚ÄúI want to upgrade this HTTP request to a WebSocket connection.‚Äù
// The callback receives:
// request: the incoming HTTP request object.
// socket: the raw TCP socket (low-level connection).
// head: the first packet of the upgraded stream (sometimes contains leftover data).
// üëâ This is where you decide whether to allow the upgrade.
// wsServer.handleUpgrade tells the ws WebSocket server:
// ‚ÄúTake this HTTP upgrade request and complete the WebSocket handshake.‚Äù
// If successful, it gives you a WebSocket object (ws) representing that connection.
// If not successful (wrong headers, bad upgrade), you should close the socket
// wsServer.emit("connection", ws, request);
// Normally, when you do new WebSocket.Server({ port }), the server automatically emits a "connection" event when a client connects.
// But since you‚Äôre using noServer: true, you have to manually emit that "connection" event after upgrading.
// This makes your earlier listenex/has connected, start treating it like a normal connection.‚Äù
// Full Flow
// Client sends an HTTP request with header:
// Connection: Upgrade and Upgrade: websocket.
// Node.js server triggers "upgrade" event.
// handleUpgrade checks & upgrades request ‚Üí gives a ws object.
// You manually fire "connection" on wsServer, which runs your WebSocket connection logic.

// start kafka consumer
// why we need kafka here ?
// when any activity is performed by the user we send the log to this logger service, and websocket server sends this to admin dashboard, but if admin is not active we need to store that data somewhere to show later ,hence kafka comes to the rescue
// here in this project we are not storing logger data in db but for real wold we can process the data with kafka and filter the data with elastic search , for large volume of data we can store in these type of database like opensearch or elasticsearch
