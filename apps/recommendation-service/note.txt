we need so many data for building recommendation system.

go to shops table copy the data and generate 50 similars shops data from chat gpt


give prompts to chatgpt to produce more data and insert .json file to mongodb atlas

} give me 50 shop data with same structure generate a ready-to-use .json file with all 50 documents that you can directly import into MongoDB Compass or Atlas. don't change the coverBanner and avatar url for different shops, also id sellerid should be mongo db objectid

**************

you have to create 50 products but you have to ensure that you are adding shop and seller id from the previous 50 shops you created {

use tensorflow library to work with ml
 npm i @tensorflow/tfjs-node
 This installs the CPU version of TensorFlow.js for Node.
If you want GPU support, use:npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu

max people use tensorflow with python but we can also use it with js



downgrade the node to version 22 to suport tensorflow
download nvm 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.6/install.sh | bash
nvm --version
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
node -v   # should show v22.x.x
npm -v

npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node


error is happening because @tensorflow/tfjs-node doesn‚Äôt yet have prebuilt binaries for Node 24 on macOS ARM (Apple Silicon). So npm tries to compile from source and fails because some headers are missing.
This is very common on new Node versions (v24+), especially on Mac M1/M2/M3 chips.
Solutions
Option 1: Downgrade Node to LTS (v22)
This is the easiest way to get @tensorflow/tfjs-node working without building from source.
Steps using nvm:
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
node -v  # should show v22.x.x
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node


Option 2: Use Docker
Run your Node 24 project inside a Docker container with Node 22.
This avoids messing with your global Node version.



classic macOS ARM + TensorFlow.js + Node issue. The log shows:
clang++: error: no such file or directory: 'NodeJs/ShopStack/node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-node/deps/include'
make: *** [Release/obj.target/tfjs_binding/binding/tfjs_backend.o] Error 1


This happens because some dependencies needed to build tfjs-node from source are missing, even if Node is now compatible. On macOS M1/M2, building tfjs-node can fail if:
Xcode command line tools aren‚Äôt fully installed.
Required libraries like libc++ headers are missing.
The npm install falls back to source build because prebuilt binaries are missing.
Make sure Xcode CLI tools are installed
xcode-select --install
If already installed, try:
sudo xcode-select --reset

2. Install dependencies via Homebrew
brew install pkg-config
brew install libtensorflow
brew install python@3.11  # optional, to make sure the right Python is used

3. Clean project
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force

4. Install tfjs-node with build-from-source
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node@4.12.0 --legacy-peer-deps


node -e "const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node'); console.log(tf.version.tfjs)"  : tells tensorflow version installed in local
python3 --version


Pre-built binaries not installable for @tensorflow/tfjs-node@4.12.0 and node@22.19.0
clang++: error: no such file or directory: '.../tfjs-node/deps/include'
root cause:
üëâ @tensorflow/tfjs-node does not provide prebuilt binaries for Node 22 (or Node 24) on macOS ARM64 (M1/M2/M3).
When it tries to fall back to compiling from source, it fails because the expected TensorFlow headers (deps/include) aren‚Äôt available.


What is Xcode?
Xcode is Apple‚Äôs official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for building apps on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
It comes with compilers, SDKs, and tools (like clang, make, etc.) that are also required for building native Node.js addons (such as @tensorflow/tfjs-node, sharp, bcrypt, etc.).
Even if you don‚Äôt build Apple apps, many Node packages need Xcode Command Line Tools to compile C/C++/Objective-C bindings.

xcodebuild -version
xcode-select -p: this should give /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

gcc --version or clang --version
Apple clang version 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.5)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin24.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
You already have Apple Clang (comes with Xcode Command Line Tools).
‚úÖ It‚Äôs targeting arm64 ‚Üí perfect for your M4 chip.
‚úÖ This compiler is what Node.js uses to build native addons (like @tensorflow/tfjs-node, sharp, bcrypt, etc.).


node -e "console.log(process.arch)" : it should give arm64



For Node.js native modules (like @tensorflow/tfjs-node, sharp, bcrypt, etc.):
üëâ Command Line Tools are enough. You don‚Äôt need the full Xcode app.

For building iOS/macOS apps (Swift/Objective-C, iPhone apps, etc.):
üëâ You‚Äôll need the full Xcode IDE from the Mac App Store.

Your errors come from two combined issues:
No prebuilt TensorFlow binary exists for your exact setup (@tensorflow/tfjs-node@4.22.0 + Node 20.19.5 + macOS arm64). That‚Äôs why npm tries to compile from source.
The source build fails because the TensorFlow C library (libtensorflow) headers (deps/include) are missing ‚Äî the download step (libtensorflow_r2_7_darwin_arm64_cpu.tar.gz) is returning 404 Not Found.
So the package cannot build either from binary or source.



npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm --legacy-peer-deps
Normally, @tensorflow/tfjs-node uses native TensorFlow C++ bindings, which require compilation and heavy dependencies (that‚Äôs why you got all those node-gyp errors).

But @tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm uses WebAssembly instead of native C++:
‚úÖ No compilation issues
‚úÖ Runs cross-platform (Mac M1, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
‚úÖ Works both in browser and Node.js
‚ùå A bit slower than native tfjs-node
So it‚Äôs a portable fallback backend for TensorFlow.js.

WASM = WebAssembly
It‚Äôs a binary instruction format that runs in web browsers and Node.js.
Think of it like a low-level virtual machine (similar to how JVM works for Java).
It allows code written in other languages (like C, C++, Rust, Go) to run efficiently in the browser or Node.
It‚Äôs fast, portable, and sandboxed (safe to run).



404 Not Found on https://storage.googleapis.com/tf-builds/pre-built-binary/napi-v8/4.22.0/CPU-darwin-4.22.0.tar.gz
TensorFlow team hasn‚Äôt published prebuilt binaries for your Node 20 + macOS ARM64 combo.
So it tries to fall back to building from source
Build fails
clang++: error: no such file or directory: 'NodeJs/ShopStack/node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-node/deps/include'
Your machine doesn‚Äôt have the required C++ toolchain / headers to build TensorFlow from source.


nvm uninstall 18
nvm alias default 22
nvm use 22
nvm ls

https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/setup
fixed the issue by running this command:
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs

@tensorflow/tfjs
Pure JavaScript version
Runs on anywhere JavaScript runs (Node.js, browsers, React Native).
Uses CPU backend by default (@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-cpu).
You can add extra backends (wasm, webgl) if needed.
Slower for training because it doesn‚Äôt use native TensorFlow C++ bindings.
Works cross-platform with no compilation issues ‚Üí that‚Äôs why it installed easily.

‚ö° @tensorflow/tfjs-node
TensorFlow.js Node.js binding.
Wraps the native TensorFlow C++ library.
Provides much faster training and inference (because it uses optimized C++ kernels instead of JS).
Supports GPU acceleration if you install @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu.
Heavier package (~100MB+).
Needs to download prebuilt binaries ‚Üí why it failed on your Mac ARM (M1/M2/M3).

ü§î Will it cause problems if you only use @tensorflow/tfjs?
No problem for functionality ‚Üí your collaborative filtering recommendation model will still work.
Only difference is performance:
tfjs-node: fast (C++ backend, closer to real TensorFlow speed).
tfjs: slower (pure JS, runs on CPU).
For light workloads (like your recommender), @tensorflow/tfjs is usually fine.
For heavy training (large models, lots of data), you‚Äôd feel the slowdown.
